**                                                                                  **Adaptive Study Guide Generator**

AI-powered personalized learning platform that extracts educational content from YouTube videos, summarizes it intelligently, explains it in a simplified manner, and generates adaptive quizzes to enhance student learning.

**Project Overview**

The Adaptive Study Guide Generator is an AI-driven e-learning platform designed to help learners understand topics from YouTube videos more effectively.

1)Takes a YouTube video URL (supports multiple languages).

2)Extracts text using advanced speech-to-text techniques.

3)Summarizes content into concise, structured notes using NLP models.

4)Explains content in a learner-friendly way.

5)Generates quizzes with 5–10 MCQs and True/False questions.

6)If a learner scores below 50%, the system re-summarizes the topic in simpler terms and regenerates the quiz.

7)The process repeats until the learner achieves mastery.

This ensures a personalized, adaptive, and effective learning experience.

**Objectives**

1)Automate text extraction and summarization from video content.

2)Enable personalized learning by dynamically adjusting quiz difficulty.

3)Provide interactive quizzes for effective self-assessment.

4)Gain hands-on experience in AI, NLP, frontend, backend, and API integrations.

**Installation & Setup**

1. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Adaptive-Study-Guide-Generator.git
cd Adaptive-Study-Guide-Generator

2. Set Up the Backend (Flask)
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py

3. Set Up the Frontend (React)
cd frontend
npm install
npm start

4. Configure API Keys
Get a YouTube Transcript API key
Set up API keys in the .env file.

**API Integrations**

YouTube Transcript API → Extracts spoken content from video.

Flask REST APIs → Handles backend requests between frontend and AI modules.

NLP Libraries (Hugging Face, SpaCy, NLTK) → Summarization, explanation, and quiz generation.

**Modules & Responsibilities**

| **Module**               | **Owner**       | **Responsibility**                               |
| ------------------------ | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Video-to-Text Extraction | Bhavana Mahathi | Built module for transcript extraction           |
| Text Summarization       | Charan Teja     | Developed summarization and explanation module   |
| Quiz Generation          | Surya Prakash   | Created adaptive quiz generation module          |
| Adaptive Feedback        | Pavan Ganesh    | Implemented re-summarization and retry mechanism |


**Adaptive Learning Logic**

If score ≥ 50% → Show results, mark topic as completed.

If score < 50% →

-> Simplify the summarized notes further.
-> Regenerate a new quiz with easier questions.
-> Allow the student to retry until mastery is achieved.
-> This ensures a personalized learning experience tailored to individual performance.
